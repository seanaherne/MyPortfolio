                  In a never ending news cycle of doom and gloom, as readers we often miss out on the positive events
                  that occur around us.
                  UPR is a positive news platform for sharing joyful or impactful stories from around the globe.
                  <br>
                  This was a group project and my role was to work on the User Interface of the app.

                <br>
                This group project was undertaken over a period of 6 weeks
                where the objective was to research the problem areas and painpoints
                of a medical device given to us by the college and to see where improvements could be made.
                Our reasearch involved an electronic blood pressure cuff.

            <p>I am currently a final year student of Digital Media Design.  My focus is on building great digital products with the user at the forefront.
              As a designer, I believe my biggest strengths are being eager to learn new things and listening intently to users needs.
              <br></br>
              In my spare time I like to obsess about all things music related. I am currently a resident DJ for the limerick based collective
              CABAL.ie which hosts music events in the Limerick area hoping to promote all types of Irish artists.
              In my spare time I also love to produce electronic music and I hope to release such music online in the near future.
