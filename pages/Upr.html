          <h1> UPR</h1>
          <p>In a never ending news cycle of doom and gloom, as readers we often miss out on the positive events
          that occur around us.
          UPR is a positive news platform for sharing joyful or impactful stories from around the globe.
          <br>
           <br>
           This was a group project and my role was to work on the User Interface of the app

        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p align="center"> This case study looks at a module from second year where we were tasked as a group to build a mobile app concept from scratch.<br>
           Our idea was to bring about a platform where users could share positive news they found to   other users. At the time we especially felt that there<br>
            was this never ending cycle of doom and gloom constantly on the news. Having a smartphone on us at all times means we can see the latest tragedy that <br>
            just happened from around the globe. While It is important to be informed and share these types of stories it can give a user a skewed view of the world,<br>
             a completely negative view. With UPR we wanted to bring a platform for anybody to share impactful or joyful journalism from around the globe, <br>
             to give hope in a sea of despair.<br>
        </p>

          <h5>Original Design Concept</h5>
          <p align="center">
            Below is the original design concept that my group created in second year. It is based around an up vote and down vote system where any user can submit <br>
            an article allowing the community to decide which positive articles are at the top of the feed.<br>

            <br>
            <img src="img/uprog2.png" class="pop-out" style="width:800px;height:350px;">


          </p>

          <h5>Redesign</h5>
          <p align="center">
            Nearing the end of my degree I decided to return to this project to change the concept slightly and redesign the UI as my skills with Sketch App have futher <br>
             developed and I wanted to bring the app to life with a modern UI. Following the redesign, I decided to remove the up and downvote system. The new system involved<br>
            a simple 'new' page and a 'trending'. The trending page is determined by how many favourites the article gets. I removed the 'Fact Of The Day' page and replaced it <br>
            with 'Picks' which would be staff picks on our favourite news articles that we find interesting or believe our users would love. The reasoning for removing the up and <br>
            downvote system was to try stop any sort of manipulation with the news which can sometimes be seen on the platform reddit which has a similar up and downvote system. <br>
            We want there to be no agenda on this app, just a way for people to see positive news.<br>
